# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You never need to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.

## Setup Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) for code formatting. The configuration is included in the
project in
the `.prettierrc.json` file.

### IDE Specific Setup Instructions

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the Prettier extension for Visual Studio Code.
2. Open Settings and change `Editor: Default Formatter` to `Prettier - Code formatter`.
3. (Optional) Setup Formatting on save by checking the `Editor: Format on Save` option in the settings.

#### WebStorm

1. If you haven't already run, this installs the necessary dependencies including prettier.

```bash 
npm install
```

2. In WebStorm `Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `JavaScript` -> `Prettier` and select Automatic Prettier
   configuration.
3. (Optional) Setup Formatting on save by going to `Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `JavaScript` ->
   `Prettier` and checking the `Run on 'Reformat Code' action`, then go to `Tools` -> `Actions on Save` and
   check `Reformat Code`
