# WesternStatesWater.Shared

This project contains shared code for the Western States Water projects (WaDE and WestDAAT). There is a need to share code between the two repositories and to achieve this quickly, we're adding this shared project as a way to contain the bits that will be intentionally copied over. This is not ideal, but it's what we're going to do for now.
